# Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus Stack

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my implementation of a comprehensive monitoring solution for Kubernetes using the Prometheus stack. I deployed Prometheus, Alert Manager, and Grafana on an AWS EKS cluster to enable robust monitoring capabilities.

I deployed the initial setup of Prometheus for the EKS Cluster with Helm, while the Kubernetes Operator manages the running Prometheus setup.

## Technologies Used
- AWS EKS
- eksctl
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Alert Manager
- Linux

## Implementation

### EKS Cluster Deployment
I used eksctl to provision and configure an EKS cluster on AWS. This provided a fully managed Kubernetes environment for my monitoring stack.

### Prometheus Stack Installation
I deployed the complete Prometheus monitoring stack using Helm charts. The installation included:
- Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- Alert Manager for handling alerts and notifications

### Configuration and Customization
I configured the Prometheus Operator to scrape metrics from the Kubernetes API server and all workloads running in the cluster.

### Dashboard Setup
I set up multiple Grafana dashboards to visualize:
- Cluster-level metrics
- Node performance statistics
- Pod resource utilization
- Application-specific metrics

### Alert Configuration
I configured alerting rules for critical conditions and integrated Alert Manager with notification channels.

## Results
This implementation provides comprehensive visibility into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster. The monitoring stack helps with:
- Proactive issue detection
- Performance optimization
- Capacity planning
- Troubleshooting

## Conclusion
The Prometheus stack deployment provides a robust foundation for monitoring containerized applications in Kubernetes. The solution is scalable and can be extended to monitor additional services as needed.
